## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS Variables
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

- Chose to use CSS Grid as the layout for this challenge. The design has both rows and columns.
- In mobile view not sure if I need rows in the card container. And then I am not sure if I should make each card a grid element and use columns so place the icon or if I should just use a margin on the left to push the icon over.
